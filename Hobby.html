            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Since I was three, skateboarding has been a big part of my life. I had a backyard skate bowl during elementary school, and I've loved it ever since. It's not just about the sport; it's about the friends I've made and the bond it created with my brothers and dad. In 2020, I hit a rough patch with a bad ankle sprain that took me off the board for a while. Recovering was tough, but recently, I got back into skateboarding, finding joy in it once again. Riding brings a sense of accomplishment and the simple happiness of reconnecting with a passion that's been a constant in my life.
